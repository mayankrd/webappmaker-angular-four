<h1>WebAppMaker</h1>


<p>Web App Maker is a MEAN Stack project. I built this project in summer of 2017. Also, I designed this for students who'd refer the project during my position as Teaching assistant at Northeastern University. I built this app using Angular 1 when I was a student of Web Development class. Using WebAppMaker, users can create websites in seconds. It is a bare bone MEAN Stack app intended to help users create websites easily. Users can login using facebook or by registering. They can create several websites. Each Website is made of pages. Each page is made up of widgets. HTML, YouTube, Header, Text make up widgets. Users have flexibility to edit everything.</p>
